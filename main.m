% Hypervolume-Based Evaluation and Ranking Technique (HEART) for Multi-Criteria Assessment
% Developed by Kaan Deveci (devecik@itu.edu.tr)
%
% This script implements the HEART methodology as presented in the following publication:
% Deveci, Kaan, and O. Guler. "Ranking Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets with Hypervolume-Based Approach:
% An Application for Multi-Criteria Assessment of Energy Alternatives." Applied Soft Computing (2023): 111038.
